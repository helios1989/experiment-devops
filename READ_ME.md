after shift from work, I got a chance to review ai-100 and i learn some azure services that lure my curiousity to dig more about machine learning so i started to read their documentation and try their lab exercises . From there i am introduce and get a hands on experience on azure machine learning studio, azure cognitive search, azure cognitive computer vision, azure qna framework and azure cbot framework.In my perspective while reading and doing the handson exercise i reckon that azure makes everything easier and 
achievable for developers to engage in AI and machine learning as lots of examples and even source code are also provided too.For conclusion, on my next study in AI, I will try provision a machine learning workspace and possibly deploy some usefull ai apps which is built  in CNF architechture.
